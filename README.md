# XIWeb
DSP Web Front-End Interface

XIWeb is a front-end interface for the DarkStarProject FFXI server. When installed, it can be used to offer a web portal for
use with your FFXI private server.

This project is still being developed, and any changes will be added to this file.

Due to the infancy of this system, it is not available for testing. The installation system, which is required to use it, 
is still being developed, and will not be available for some time. Once it is finished, the source can be used for
testing on your own server. 

This was done intentionally to prevent early testing and bug reporting. Although bug fixes are important, I do not want
to be flooded with bugs at the very beginning of the project, and would rather wait until the system is more polished
before requesting testers.

This software requires at 'minimum' the following versions:

PHP 5.5
MySQL 5.5
Apache2
